/**
 * Rewrite the changelog's pending section so it lists every unreleased commit,
 * in the order they landed, using the exact commit subjects.
 *
 * This is the local counterpart to the `check_changelog` job in the shared
 * `nodejs-build-and-test` workflow: run this before pushing, and CI will agree.
 * The check deliberately stays in CI rather than this script writing from CI -
 * a pull request from a fork cannot be written back to, which is precisely the
 * case where changelog entries have gone missing before.
 *
 *   npm run changelog:sync
 *
 * Existing " (@user)" credits are preserved. Nothing else in the file is
 * touched, and running it twice changes nothing the second time. A subject that
 * appears more than once gets a single bullet.
